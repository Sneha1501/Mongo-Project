PROJECT TITLE: COURTROOM SCHEDULING

Executive Summary:

The courtroom scheduling database is designed to efficiently manage the allocation of courtrooms, judges, and hearings. Utilizing MongoDB, this document outlines the structure of the database, which includes five collections: Courtrooms, Judges, Hearings, Cases, and Users. Each collection is meticulously designed to store relevant information and facilitate seamless scheduling and tracking of courtroom activities.

Project Requirement:

The primary objective of this project is to create a MongoDB database that effectively manages courtroom scheduling. Key requirements include:

Store information about courtrooms, judges, hearings, cases, and users.
Allow efficient scheduling of hearings, ensuring that courtrooms and judges are available.
Enable tracking of case information associated with each hearing.
Provide authentication and authorization mechanisms for users accessing the system.
